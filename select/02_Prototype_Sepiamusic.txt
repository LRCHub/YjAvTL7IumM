They spoiled me
I broke down
'Cause i was
Bending all their rules
A reject
A mistake
That didn't fit the box

I moved on
A fixed me
Ignoring
Malfunction inside
And found out
I could hide
I never made the cut

CHORUS
This is how i feel
Like a prototype
Can i pass the test
Can i even try

This is how i feel
Like a prototype
When i'm looking strong
I crack up inside

This is how i feel
Like a prototype
Just a prototype

And sometimes
I hear them
They're scheming
How to raise the stakes
So i will
Be shut down
So i'll be shorting out

(Chorus)

This is how i feel
Like a prototype
I will always feel
Like a prototype

(Chorus)
