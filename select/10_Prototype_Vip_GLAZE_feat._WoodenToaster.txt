I wanna be a mobile supercomputer
A vision of the future
Begin the cyber revolution
Mechanical fusion
The perfect evolution
With systematic harmony
I'll run onto eternity
And although this metal's part of me
I shall not lose my sanity

Shatter the flesh and reinforce the bone
Embrace this carbon mesh this power's all my own

These simple parts of mine are interchangeable
Unlimited connections when you're digital
Becoming one with wires is sensational
Go out with the old and in with the new

Stomp the ground
Resonating sound surrounds me
A power best described as godly
At life's intersection, reaching for perfection
Requiring no more correction
Rip away the obsolete
Clean format, update complete
No more emotions
Such a novelty
The future key
That would be
So clear to me

Shatter the flesh and reinforce the bone
Embrace this carbon mesh this power's all my own

These simple parts of mine are interchangeable
Unlimited connections when you're digital
Becoming one with wires is sensational
Go out with the old and in with the new
My hunger for perfection is insatiable
A prototype that's fully operational
This armoured alloy shell is unbreakable
My existence is irreplaceable

Shatter the flesh and reinforce the bone
Embrace this carbon mesh this power's all my own

These simple parts of mine are interchangeable
Unlimited connections when you're digital
Becoming one with wires is sensational
Go out with the old and in with the new
My hunger for perfection is insatiable
A prototype that's fully operational
This armoured alloy shell is unbreakable
My existence is irreplaceable
