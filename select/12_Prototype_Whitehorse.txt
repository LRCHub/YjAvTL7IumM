There goes one of a kind
There goes the neighbourhood
There goes a prototype
There goes a house of sun

Here comes the second wave
Here come the aftershocks
Here comes the Rodeo
Here comes the cannonball

What of the missing link
What could we never know
He looks just like you do
But not his brothers though

Dear Maggie was it right
Did you see the things you hoped you might
I'm sorry that we never got you there
Havana City in the April night
